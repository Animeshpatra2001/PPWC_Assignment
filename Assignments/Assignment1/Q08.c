/*8. Write a program that calculates the acceleration (m/s2) of a jet fighter launched from an aircraft-carrier
catapult, given the jetâ€™s takeoff speed in km/hr and the distance (meters) over which the catapult accelerates 
the jet from rest to takeoff. Assume constant acceleration. Also calculate the time (seconds) for
the fighter to be accelerated to takeoff speed. When you prompt the user, be sure to indicate the units
for each input. For one run, use a takeoff speed of 278 km/hr and a distance of 94 meters. Relevant
formulas (v = velocity, a = acceleration, t = time, and s = distance)
v = at
s =1/2(at^2)
